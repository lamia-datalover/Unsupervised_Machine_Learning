# What is this project about and what did I do ?
The goal of this project is to perform unsupervised topic extraction on text data and compare the results to the target variable.

First, I needed to understand the dataset, which contains 18,000 newsgroup posts on 20 topics .
I worked with a sample of 5,000 rows for topic modeling.

I began by extracting the text that appears after the word 'Subject,' and then I merged sentences that contained spaces or alphanumeric data. Afterward, I converted the documents to lowercase.

For the NLP tasks, I utilized the Spacy library and chose the English language since my text is in English. I removed stop words and performed lemmatization. Following that, I detokenized the text to preserve contextual information between words, which is crucial for TF-IDF analysis.

I used the TF-IDF matrix and applied truncated SVD with 20 topics as the number of components. I split the matrix 'U,' which provided information about the different topics present in each document.

Next, I compared the topics generated by the LSA model to the real classified topics. There was a significant difference because LSA is based on the hypothesis that a document can be related to multiple topics. This complexity in interpretation allows for more realistic topic models, as real-life documents often relate to various topics, unlike the classified topics where each document has only one assigned topic.
